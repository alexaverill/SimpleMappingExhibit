## Troubleshooting

1. I set up my map and zoom levels, but when I zoom in to far on one of my base layers it goes grey!
   This is likely caused by having a base layer that doesn't support that zoom level, double check the values provided with the map tiles, or load your data into the editor and then test the zoom levels and set the maximum level so that the map doesn't go grey.
